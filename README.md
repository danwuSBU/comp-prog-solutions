# comp-prog-solutions
This is where I back up my C++ comp prog solutions.
## comp-prog-solutions/finished problems
Here I'm putting problems I've completed. At the top of each file, there will be a link to the problem page on the online judge website. My solutions are correct and accepted unless noted otherwise (a TLE for time limit exceeded at the end of a filename, for example).
## comp-prog-solutions/data structures
Useful data structures that are not implemented in C++ STL.
